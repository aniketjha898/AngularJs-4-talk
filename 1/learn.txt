1. Include angular as a script file in index.html
2. use ng-app to bootstrap the angular
ng-app is a directive, It is starting point of our app.
It angular first looks for this directive if found angular bootstrap itself and starts to watch.

1. Put it at level of body tag.
11 + 12 = {{ 11 + 12 }}
{{ }} binding expression it takes it some dynamic content which is evaluted at run time.

2. Now create two sibbling divs inside body tag and put same expression in both.
we see that div with angular ng-app directive on it is resolved which means it is watched by angular, whereas second div is not watched by angular.
So ng-app level element and its all children are watched by angular.
Thus angular watches and is responsible for any change that occurs inside ng-app directive element level tag.
