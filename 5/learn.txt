ng-repeat is used to repeat a element tag several times in iterations of array data.
ng-repeat = "sudent in students"
is to be understood as 
give me a sudent(element of array) in students(array).
thus student var hold a element of student array while students is array itself.
By default it is required that every data model of array data model needs to be unique in nature,
this is required in order to track list of elements sowe need to use unique items.
Default tracking is done by value of element.
we must use unique Id provided by backend but if not avialable we may use element's index to track in case duplicate values.

$index can be used to  find index value of current elemnet during iteration in current ng-repeat.
$parent.$index thus will give index of parent in case parent is under ng-repeat

Another way of finding parent index (recommended)
if we dont have any Id prp so we will use $index in that case as default else id.
on parent repeat place one more directie ng-init
it is used to initailse some data that needs to accesed  inside this element tag.

ng-init=" parentId = $index"
(if Id exist then write student.id instead - recommended )
ng-init=" parentId = sudent.id"
