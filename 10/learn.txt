If we want to load html from different file ng-include is best choice.
It lets you split the code b/w multiple templates.

ng-include vs directives
simple if your html content needs to be a more static like means it doenot do many evalution on its own then use directive.
Header is prefered(not its own manipultaion logic may include nested directives but.)
but section of template that needs a lot of evalutaion like acordion, buttons, lists must be put in seprate directives.
lists,  carousel, accordion or calendar.(its own manipulation logic)
