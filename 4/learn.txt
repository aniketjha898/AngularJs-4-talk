First way to display an image is hardcoding it in src like on any static page.

To get it dynamically we will use {{ dataBinding }}.
src="{{ image.src }}" where image is a property on $scope.

Note on console we find 404 image request error ?
First of all as index.html is being parsed a request is generated to 
" %7B%7B%20image.src%20%7D%7D " which is nothing but
    {{ image.src }}
as till this instant angular didn't evaluted {{ image.src }} expression it made request to wrong 
resource and thus 404 error.
When the parsing is completed and angular evalutes every {{ }} it puts expression values and a new 
request is made to server for image.
Thus loaded in this request.
This all took 2 request, having one as 404 error.
Thus must use ng-src which evalutes and put value once complete parses an doesnot make any request 
in b/w.
Only after parsing and evaluation it makes request for image resource.
